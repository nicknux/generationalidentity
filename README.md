# Uniform Generational Identity
## Problem
The Western culture had adopted naming generations after demographic cohorts which are roughly defined by the years the individuals within each cohort were born. But mostly this grouping is based on cultural and behavioral similarities of the people within a certain age group.

These generation names are ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation#List_of_named_generations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation#List_of_named_generations)):

- The Lost Generation (1883-1900)
- The Greatest Generation (1901-1927)
- The Silent Generation (1928-1945)
- Baby Boomers (1946-1964)
- Generation X (1965-1980)
- Millenials (1981-1996)
- Generation Z (mid to late 90s - about 2012)
- Generation Alpha (2010-2020s)

This identification scheme arbitrarily assigns both the name and the beginning and ending years to identify each generation. There is no uniformity in the intervening years and the names are determined by whichever catches on in the mainstream media. There is no standard or framework that articulates how the years and names are going to be assigned in the future. Since our culture have become so reliant on using and referencing them and, due to social media, these generational identifiers have crossed over to non-western cultures as well, it is important to build a standard or framework.

## Solution
The Uniform Generational Identifier aims to bridge the gap between the familial and named generation a person belongs to.

### Epoch Generation - Reference Point
We are at a unique point in our history wherein a majority of our elderly belong to a well-known "named" generation -- Baby Boomers. The distinction between Generation X and Millenials are fuzzy and Generation Z and Alpha are so new that the mainstream media doesn't know how to properly identify them yet. The contributions of the Baby Boomers to our current world view, pop culture, and technology are so unique and significant that it could be thought of as its own "Age" and we can use it as a reference point for identying future generations. In the same way that the Julian and Gregorian Calendar had used the birth of Christ as the epoch identified by BC (Before Christ) and AD ([Anno Domini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini)).

### Naming
Borrowing from the idea of BC and AD in the Gregorian Calendar, we would instead use BB to mean BEFORE Babyboomer and AB to mean AFTER Babyboomer. A Baby Boomer's children are then AB1, and their children's children are AB2, and so on. While their parents are BB1 and their grandparents as BB2, and so on.

But unlike BC and AD where there is no year 0, there is a special identifier for generation "zero" and that is BB0, or simply Baby Boomer.

### Generation AB1
Baby boomers is most often defined as those individuals born between 1946 and 1964 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers)). If the average age of boomers having children was 25, that would put Generation AB1 as most likely born between 1971 and 1989. This means there's a potential gap for the years 1965 and 1970, wherein the person born in these years are not technically baby boomers and they are not children of baby boomers. To correct for this error in the convention, they are also designated as generation AB1.

### Zeitgeists Within A Generation
It is very common to have children born across decades. Let's take a family of 7 as an example: a baby boomer couple with five children. The first two kids born in the 1970s, third and fourth born in the 1980s, and a fifth child born in early 1990s.

We cannot discount the fact that even if these children are in the same generation, they are born in different times. The 70s, 80s, and 90s were very different along cultural, intellectual, economic, and social dimensions. We can say that the zeitgeist of each these decades are what the traditional generation names are trying to capture. To call those a "generation" would be a misnomer.

Uniform Generational Identifier can capture these in the generation name by adding the decade to the generation name. In the above example, the first two children will be named AB1-z1970: First generation after Baby Boomer, born in 1970s.
